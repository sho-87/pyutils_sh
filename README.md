Assortment of Python utilities for my personal projects

## Requirements
 - All code tested with Python 3.6 on Windows.
 - Minor adjustments may need to be made for Python 2.7 or other operating systems, but should mostly be OK.
 - Quickest way to get a working Python installation with all the useful dependencies is to install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
